- Navigate to [replit.com](replit.com)
- Click `Start Creating`
- Create account or sign in
- Click `Create Repl` in sidebar. Find the Java template and choose it. Name your repl `1-IntroToJava`.
- Once done, you can invite mentors or leads to help you as you go on your journey using the `Invite` button in the upper right.

Side note: Repl stands for `read, execute, print, loop`. It is a way of programming where your program always stays in memory and each line you type is read, then executed and the output printed out. This is just a fast way to learn/program. Once a program is complete, we typically compile it into a program which can just run behind the scenes without the repl.
